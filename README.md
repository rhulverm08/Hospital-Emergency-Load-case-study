# Hospital-Emergency-Load-case-study
A data analytics case study analyzing the impact of air quality and environmental factors on hospital emergency room load to support proactive healthcare resource planning.

# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Load Prediction Using Environmental Data

## 📌 Project Overview
Hospitals often face sudden spikes in emergency room (ER) visits, especially related to respiratory and cardiac conditions. These surges usually occur without advance warning, leading to overcrowding, staff shortages, and increased patient waiting times.

This project is a **data analytics case study** that analyzes the relationship between **environmental factors (Air Quality Index, temperature)** and **hospital emergency room load**, enabling hospitals to move from **reactive** to **proactive** operational planning.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Sudden increases in ER patients strain hospital resources
- Most hospitals react **after** overcrowding occurs
- Lack of predictive insight leads to inefficient staffing and resource allocation

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters
- Delayed emergency care can be life-threatening
- Poor preparedness increases operational stress
- Even small forecasting improvements can significantly enhance patient safety

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze how air quality impacts emergency room visits
- Identify high-risk periods with increased ER load
- Categorize days into **Low, Medium, and High emergency risk**
- Provide actionable insights for hospital operational planning

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview
- Daily environmental and hospital emergency data
- Includes:
  - Air Quality Index (AQI)
  - Temperature
  - Emergency Room visit count
- Covers multiple days to analyze trends and patterns

> *Note: Dataset is simulated for case study purposes.*

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI / SQL / Python (Analytics-ready)**
- Data Cleaning & Validation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Business-oriented insights & reporting
- Visual storytelling (charts & trends)

---

## 🔄 Analysis Methodology
1. Reviewed environmental and ER visit data
2. Cleaned and validated the dataset
3. Categorized AQI values into severity levels
4. Analyzed correlation between AQI and ER visits
5. Identified high-risk pollution periods
6. Translated insights into operational recommendations

---

## 📊 Key Analysis & Visuals
- Relationship between AQI and ER visit trends
- Identification of pollution-driven spikes in emergency load
- Daily and seasonal variation analysis
- Risk-based categorization for hospital preparedness

---

## 🚨 Emergency Risk Categorization
| AQI Level | Emergency Risk |
|---------|---------------|
| Low AQI | Low Risk |
| Moderate AQI | Medium Risk |
| High AQI | High Risk |

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Higher AQI levels are strongly associated with increased ER visits
- ER spikes are prominent when AQI crosses unsafe thresholds
- Pollution impact shows near real-time pressure on hospitals
- Environmental data can serve as an early warning indicator

---

## 🏥 Business Recommendations
### 1. Proactive Staffing
- Increase ER staff during high AQI days
- Maintain on-call doctors and nurses

### 2. Resource Planning
- Pre-stock oxygen cylinders and respiratory equipment
- Ensure ICU and ER bed readiness

### 3. Early Warning System
- Integrate AQI forecast APIs
- Trigger internal alerts for hospital management

### 4. Preventive Public Health Actions
- Notify vulnerable groups during severe pollution days
- Coordinate with local authorities for advisories

---

## 📊 Expected Impact
- 15–20% reduction in ER overcrowding
- Lower patient waiting times
- Improved emergency response efficiency
- Reduced last-minute staffing costs
- Better patient outcomes

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset is simulated
- External factors like festivals or flu outbreaks not included
- Correlation does not imply direct causation

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Machine learning-based ER load forecasting
- Real-time AQI API integration
- Interactive Power BI dashboard
- City-level emergency demand prediction
